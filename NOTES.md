## syslinux fails with Invalid Argument on 486+ systems

This appears to be due to a bug in syslinux dealing with memory handling on systems without
e820 support by checking the wrong register in the BIOS callback according to some sluething
on Discord

## Linux kernel only starts on machines with "enhanced" 486

Unclear as to cause, it works on "enhanced" 486s, but may be a problem with the toolchain
or busybox. Others on Discord were able to compile it successfully to run on a 486 with
the same config which makes things even more mysterious ...
